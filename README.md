Overview

This project, implemented in Solidity, demonstrates fundamental concepts of error handling and arithmetic operations within smart contracts. It includes functions for computing squares and cubes of numbers, ensuring input validation, and manipulating state variables for basic arithmetic operations.

Description

The ErrorHandling contract is an educational example of error-handling techniques and arithmetic computations in Solidity smart contracts. It features:

square(uint value): Computes the square of a given integer value, ensuring the value is non-zero before calculation.
cube(uint value): Computes the cube of a given integer value, with validation to prevent computation if the value is zero.
add(): Adds a constant value to a public state variable, demonstrating basic state manipulation and assertion of conditions.
